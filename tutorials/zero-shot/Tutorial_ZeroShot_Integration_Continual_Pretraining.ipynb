        "This tutorial covers the zero-shot integration with continual pre-trained scGPT. This particular workflow works for scRNA-seq datasets without fine-tuning (or any extensive training) of scGPT.\n",

        "Continual pre-trained scGPT (scGPT_CP) is a model that inherits the pre-trained scGPT whole-human model checkpoint, and is further supervised by extra cell type labels (using the [Tabula Sapiens](https://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/) dataset) during the continual pre-training stage. We observed that the scGPT_CP model can achieve comparable or better zero-shot performance on cell embedding related tasks compared to the original checkpoint, especially on datasets with observable technical batch effects.\n",
